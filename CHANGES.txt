3.3.0: (Jun 4, 2025)
- Added support for rule-based segments. These segments determine membership at runtime by evaluating their configured rules against the user attributes provided to the SDK.
- Added support for feature flag prerequisites. This allows customers to define dependency conditions between flags, which are evaluated before any allowlists or targeting rules.
- Added two new configuration options to control the behavior of the persisted rollout plan cache. Use `rolloutCacheConfiguration` in the config.
- Fixed performance issue evaluating flags.

3.2.0: (Apr 1, 2025)
 - Added a new optional argument to the client `getTreatment` methods to allow passing additional evaluation options, such as a map of properties to append to the generated impressions sent to Split backend. Read more in our docs.

- Fixed issue when converting UInt32 to Int in 32 bit platforms.

3.1.0: (Jan 20, 2025)

2.26.1: (Jul 30, 2024)
- Added wildcard host filtering for certificate pinning.

2.26.0: (Jul 29, 2024)

2.25.1: (Jun 3, 2024)
- Updated impressions deduplication to apply across sessions.

2.25.0: (May 21, 2024)
- Added support for targeting rules based on semantic versions (https://semver.org/).

2.24.7: (May 8, 2024)
- Fixed issue triggering SDK Ready when using a local method reference to the factory. This issue was introduced in version 2.24.5.

2.24.6: (Apr 10, 2024)
- Fixed issue when triggering SDK events

2.24.0: (Dec 6, 2023)
- Added `prefix` configuration parameter, which allows to use a prefix when naming the SDK storage. Use this when using multiple `SplitFactory` instances with the same SDK key.

2.23.0: (Nov 1, 2023)
- Added support for Flag Sets on the SDK, which enables grouping feature flags and interacting with the group rather than individually (more details in our documentation):
  - Added new variations of the get treatment methods to support evaluating flags in given flag set/s.
    - getTreatmentsByFlagSet and getTreatmentsByFlagSets
    - getTreatmentWithConfigByFlagSets and getTreatmentsWithConfigByFlagSets
  - Added a new optional Split Filter configuration option. This allows the SDK and Split services to only synchronize the flags in the specified flag sets, avoiding unused or unwanted flags from being synced on the SDK instance, bringing all the benefits from a reduced payload.
  - Updated the following SDK manager methods to expose flag sets on flag views.
- Added `defaultTreatment` property to the `SplitView` object returned by the `split` and `splits` methods of the SDK manager. 
- Removed APIs that were not in use and required a privacy manifest.

Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.

2.16.2: (Sep 1, 2022)
- Memory handling improvements.

2.16.1: (Aug 8, 2022)

Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
- Updated the synchronization flow to be more reliable in the event of an edge case generating delay in cache purge propagation, keeping the SDK cache properly synced.

2.14.0: (May 12, 2022)

    - New control notification for environment scoped streaming reset.

- Fixed issue occurring sometimes when SDK Update is fired

- Added impressions dedupe logic to avoid sending duplicated impressions:  
   - Added `OPTIMIZED` and `DEBUG` modes in order to enabling/disabling how impressions are going to be sent into Split servers,
        - `OPTIMIZED`: will send unique impressions in a timeframe in order to reduce how many times impressions are posted to Split.
        - `DEBUG`: will send every impression generated to Split.

2.6.0: (Ago 11, 2020)
